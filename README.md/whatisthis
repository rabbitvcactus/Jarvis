# Jarvis
Bot for my discord server.

## Running

You will need is a credentials.json file with the credentials:

```js
{
    "token": "your bot token",
    "client_id": "your client_id",
    "server_id": "your server_id"
}
```
This bot was only designed to act upon one server, hence why there's a server_id.

## Requirements

- Python 3.5+
- Async version of discord.py
- lxml
